MS Access DB &amp; VB Code:  Bell's Music Shop "Rental Orders" FORM
Note:  In process of migrating from current OS/DB/CODE platform to Lynix/Python platform

Status:  Active

Purpose:
Automate customer instrument purchase and rental process.
Initially, the busy music shop had manual forms at register, which created long lines outside the door and around building.  
Automation and convenience is highly needed for kios and web application.
